  This repository is a work in progress for Thomas Gauffroy-Naudinâ€™s DH
  certificate project, supervised by Simon Gabay at the University of Geneva.


  It currently contains a sample corpus for training an OCR model to transcribe
  20th-century print periodicals, specifically using data from the French jazz
  magazine JAZZ HOT from 1966 to 1980. The sources primarily focus on the news
  and program columns of these magazines.
